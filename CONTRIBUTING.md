**Important Disclamer:** This project is part of a university assignment, it is not related to any productive use.  
Please not due to this some parts of the project are mocked as they were out of scope (see [Code/bad_walden_stadtwerke/README.md](Code/README.md)) and following are some unusual implications such as Mockito running in compile scope. 


## Project Structure:
**BPMN Modelling:** The key processes and software elements are illustrated in the BPMN models found in [Documents/Application Software](Documents/Application Software).  
**Datamodel:** The structure of our database is outlined under [Documents/Datamodel](Documents/Datamodel).  
**UI Modelling:** The UI models are found under [Documents/UI](Documents/UI).  


## How to Contribute:
**Get started**: Get yourself a local copy of the code. For this, follow the [How to run the code section in our readme](Code/README.md).  
**Make Changes:** Follow the standard Java coding conventions when making changes.  
**Write Unit Tests:** All contributions should come with unit tests to ensure a robust codebase.  
**Test on your machine:** We're using Maven for our project, please make sure you do a clean - install, to test wheter everything works.  
**Submit a Pull Request:** Once your changes and tests are ready, submit a pull request to the main project. Describe your changes in detail so the maintainers can understand what you've done.  
**Address Review Comments:** If there are any comments on your pull request, address them promptly. This helps maintain the quality of the code and ensures everyone can understand your contribution.
