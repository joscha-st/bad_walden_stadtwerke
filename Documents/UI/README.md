## Structure

The UI is structured into several Pages, each with multiple states.
For each page, the top frame is the initial state when the page is loaded. Below the top frame, there are several states that the page can be in. The states are triggered by user interaction, such as clicking a button or selecting an option from a dropdown menu.
