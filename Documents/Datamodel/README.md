## Database design

A shared database will be used for all *Bad Walden* software.  
The following EER diagram displays the databased design with tables for the *stadtwerke* software as well as used shared tables:

There will be more shared use tables in the database, catering for needs of other development groups and designed on their end.
The diagram can also be generated from plantUML code:
