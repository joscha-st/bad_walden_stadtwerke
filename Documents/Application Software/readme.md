# Modelling

## Application Software
This repository contains BPMN diagrams created for modeling various processes within the context of public utilities. BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a standardized graphical notation for representing business processes, enabling the visualization and analysis of complex workflows. 
We display general cases (= GC) such as classification in the basic supply, tariff changes and relocation. We have also created diagrams specially tailored to the user interface (= UI), which describe the login process, processes for customers such as a consumption overview and processes for power users such as customer management.
